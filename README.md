# Aliucord-Vencord-theme


Vencord theme (with Vencord color scheme) ported over with the permission of @Synqat 

This theme tries to follow the color scheme a little more accurately than the original, like some elements changing from light pink to a darker one found on the https://vencord.dev site.

SCREENSHOTS NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE DUE TO ANDROID 14

Elements in a14 that don't get themed: chatbox input background, active dm button background, channel text color (the icons still work) etc. Not to worry, they will work fine for you, unless you are also on a14.
