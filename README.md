# Aliucord-Vencord-theme


Vencord-theme (with vencord color scheme) ported over with the permission of @Synqat 

This theme tries to follow the color scheme a little more than the original, like some elements changing from light pink to a darker one to match the https://vencord.dev website.

**Elements in Android 14 that don't get themed: chatbox input background, active dm button background, channel colors (the icons still work) etc. 
Not to worry, they will work fine for you, unless you're also on Android 14.*
