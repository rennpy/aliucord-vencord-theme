# Aliucord-Vencord-theme


A theme (using vencord's colors) ported over with the permission of @/Synqat

# **Slight changes:**
This theme tries to follow the color scheme a little more than the original, by making additional elements use the light pink that matches the https://vencord.dev website instead of keeping them dull

**Elements in Android 14 that don't get themed: chatbox input background, active dm button background, channel colors (the icons still work) etc. 
Not to worry, they will work fine for you, unless you're also on Android 12+.*
